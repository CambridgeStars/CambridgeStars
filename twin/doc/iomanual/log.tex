\section{file.log}
\label{sec:log}

This file contains the exit code with which the Eggleton code terminated.
Usually, the file lists an explanation of these codes at the top of
the files, but for grids these lines may lack.

\begin{description}
\item[-2]  Requested mesh too large (\texttt{BEGINN})
\item[-1]  No timesteps required (\texttt{STAR12})
